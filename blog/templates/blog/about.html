        <p>
            {{ APP_TITLE }} is a web application for blogging.  Users may encrypt blog posts with a password.  You can use a different password for each blog post.  
            {{ APP_TITLE}} was created using the Python Django web application framework.
        </p>
        <p>
            Anyone can read any published blog posts on {{ APP_TITLE }}.  
            To create blog posts, you must sign in with a verified email address and password.  
        </p>
        <p>
            Only you are allowed to read or edit your draft (unpublished) blog posts.* 
        </p>
        <p>
            You can encrypt and decrypt your blog posts using a password.  You can use a different password to encrypt and decrypt each blog post.  You may opt to have {{ APP_TITLE }} save the password, but this is not recommended. 
        </p>
<p>
Topics for blog post encryption, for example, might include 'What Happened in Vegas' or your Manifesto.

        Cryptograpy
        </h3>
        <p>
            {{ APP_TITLE}} uses symmetric (“secret key”) authenticated cryptography, specifically the Fernet implementation in the Python  <a href="https://cryptography.io/" target="_blank"> Cryptography</a> library.  The Fernet implementation is said to guarantee that a message encrypted using Fernet cannot be manipulated or read without the key.  The protection may be undermined, however it the user employs a weak encryption password.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Fernet implementation is built on top of the following standard cryptographic primitives:
        </p>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    AES in CBC mode with a 128-bit key for encryption; using PKCS7 padding.
                </li>
                <li>
                    HMAC using SHA256 for authentication.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Initialization vectors are generated using os.urandom().
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>

            This instance of {{ APP_TITLE }} is in the early development (alpha) stage and is virtually untested.  {{ APP_TITLE }} is not ready for production usage.  At this time long-term maintenance of user accounts or content is impossible.  The security and privacy of any information stored on the current version of {{ APP_TITLE }} is  uncertain.  Enjoy!

        <h4>Where are the magical icons?</h4>
        <p>
            If you are using the consistently dysfunctional Internet Explorer web browser, too bad for you.  IE permits further degradation of the user experience by allowing the download of fonts to be blocked.  These fonts are required for the site to function and also make the web site look pretty.  If you are browing on your work computer and your workplace has further broken your lame IE browser by blocking font download, use Google Chrome or Firefox, and never use IE again.
