            Cryptoblog is a web application for blogging.
            Cryptoblog was created using the Python Django web application framework.
        </p>
        <p>
            Anyone can read any published blog posts.
            To create blog posts, you must sign in with a username and password, which you may request by <a href="mailto:johnkraus3@gmail.com" target="_blank">email from the site administrator.</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            Only you can read or edit your draft (unpublished) blog posts.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can encrypt and decrypt your blog posts using a password.
        </p>

        Cryptograpy
        </h3>
        <p>
            Cryptoblog uses symmetric (“secret key”) authenticated cryptography, specifically the Fernet implementation in the Python  <a href="https://cryptography.io/" target="_blank"> Cryptography</a> library.  The Fernet implementation is said to guarantee that a message encrypted using it cannot be manipulated or read without the key.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Fernet implementation is built on top of the following standard cryptographic primitives:
        </p>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    AES in CBC mode with a 128-bit key for encryption; using PKCS7 padding.
                </li>
                <li>
                    HMAC using SHA256 for authentication.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Initialization vectors are generated using os.urandom().
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h3 style="color: red;">Caution</h3>
        <p>
            This web application is in the early (alpha) stage of development and is virtually untested.  Long-term maintenance of user content or accounts is impossible at this time.  The security of any information stored on Cryptoblog is currently dubious.  Enjoy!
